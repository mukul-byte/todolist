# todolist
Todo List version 1, where you can add/cut the tasks.
This project involves the use of:
*  HTML
*  CSS
*  JavaScript
*  Node
*  Express
*  EJS Templating

One can make a list of all the task he needs to do. And can check them to cut when the task completes.  
This project is made while learning from Angela Yu webD course. Though it has some vulnerabilities, but I will make it as one would need in real life in further time.
Every day, one can a new todo list and date will be the heading.  
I also provided a work route for extending the idea ou using templates and exports object.  
While making this project, I learnt a lot og different concepts of Express, Templating, exports and functions. And also, putting this on github add a cherry on the cake of learning.
